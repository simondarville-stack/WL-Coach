EMOS TO-DO LIST 

#GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Here TO DOs live. They will be updated as smaller errors, bugs and feature requests are made for EMOS. 
Claude will evaluate and solve these. When an item is done, it should be moved to the #DONE section

**Default behavior (unless the user specifies otherwise):** solve *all* unsolved
items in the `##TO DOs` section — do not wait for the user to pick individual
items. Work through every open item, then move each finished item to `##DONE`.
For every completed item, write a short description under it stating **what was
wrong, what was changed, and the date** (European `DD/MM/YYYY`). Only deviate
from "solve everything" when the user names specific items to do (or explicitly
defers others).

##TO DOs

_(empty — everything below is done; new items go here.)_

##DONE
For every item that has been done, write what was wrong, what was changed and add a date.

#Weekly planner day view — GPP module (done 13/07/2026, v0.22.0)
**Wrong:** the full-day edit surface (`DayEditor`, opened from a day's top
banner) had no GPP-sentinel handling, so a GPP block fell through to the
generic branch — an empty prescription grid + notes textarea — and couldn't be
viewed or edited there (only `DayCard` handled GPP).
**Changed:** `DayEditor.tsx` now mirrors `DayCard`'s GPP handling — a `gpp`
sentinel header (Dumbbell + title + row count), a read-only row summary in the
body, the gear button opening the `GppBlockEditor` (instead of the exercise
detail), and the editor modal wired via a new `saveGppSection` prop passed from
`WeeklyPlanner`.

#Combo exercises — round-multiplier notation (done 13/07/2026, v0.22.0)
**Wrong:** a combo tuple like `2+2+2` was ambiguous (2 rounds of 1+1+1, or one
round of 2+2+2).
**Changed:** added an optional per-column round multiplier serialized as
`m(a+b)` — a `()` toggle in the combo reps cell wraps the tuple and shows an
editable `m` cell that behaves like the other cells (starts at 1, left +1,
right −1, ctrl+click to type). Semantics (coach's choice): **reps only** — `m`
scales volume within each set, the set count (×N) is unchanged, and `m`
absent/`1`… is a perfect no-op for existing prescriptions. Threaded through the
parser (`prescriptionParser`), counting (`comboExpansion`,
`computePrescriptionSummary`), the athlete cache (`useWeekPlans`), all display
surfaces (`StackedNotation`, `PrintWeek`, `PrintWeekDesigner`,
`TemplatePreviewDialog`, `fieldView`), the interactive grid (`PrescriptionGrid`),
the kg↔% convert/resolve paths (`WeeklyPlanner`), and analysis
(`factFetch`, `useAnalysis`). Covered by `comboMultiplier.test.ts`.

#Autosave is now standard for text fields (done 13/07/2026, v0.22.0)
**Wrong:** the coach's `/text` sentinel field in `ExerciseDetail` required an
explicit Save button; everywhere else autosaves on blur. (Its textarea updated
only local state, not `notesRef`, so an X-close would have persisted a stale
value — hence the Save button existed.)
**Changed:** the sentinel-text textarea now autosaves like every other note
field (updates `notesRef` + debounce on change, flush on blur), and the
now-redundant footer Save button + `saveSentinelNotes` helper (and the unused
`Save` icon import) were removed. Video/image sentinels already autosaved.

#Combo creation via `+` on the add line (done 13/07/2026, v0.22.0)
**Wrong:** a combo could only be built via the `/combo` wizard.
**Changed:** `ExerciseSearch` gained an inline builder — pressing `+` on the
highlighted match (by name or code) stages it as a combo member (shown as a
chip) and awaits the next; Enter commits (1 staged → plain add, 2+ → a combo via
the same `createComboExercise` path the modal uses), Backspace on an empty query
pops the last chip, Escape clears. Opt-in via a new `onAddCombo` prop
(`DayCard`/`DayEditor` pass it; other call sites keep single-add behaviour).

#Follow-up ideas from the 0.22.0 batch (done 13/07/2026, v0.23.0)
Four co-designer ideas surfaced alongside the multiplier work, all now done:
* **Athlete-side multiplier symmetry.** `parseRepsInput` (and the analysis
  off-plan combo path in `factFetch`) now parse a grouped `m(a+b)` reps entry as
  `m × Σ(parts)`, so an athlete echoing the coach's `2(1+1)` placeholder logs the
  right volume — same Option-A semantics as the planner.
* **Macro combo model honors the multiplier.** Investigation found the macro's
  structured combo tables (`planned_combos`/`planned_combo_set_lines`) are a
  **legacy, write-dead model with no editor** — the disambiguation already works
  for every combo a coach can author today (via the prescription-string model +
  the multiplier-aware summary cache). Made the one remaining consumer (the
  legacy combo counter in `useMacroCycles`) honor a grouped `m(a+b)` tuple
  (reps ×m, sets unchanged), migration-free. See Ideas below for the bigger,
  still-open consolidation this uncovered.
* **Removed dead code.** Deleted the orphaned `MacroWeekNotes.tsx` (0 importers;
  the resizable notes cell was built inline in `MacroTableV2`).
* **Interactive phase coverage strip.** The phase panel's coverage strip is now
  click-and-drag — click a week to set the phase start, drag across weeks to set
  the range — wired live to the start/end selects.

#Macro (done 13/07/2026, v0.22.0)
* **Editing a macro's dates now updates the table.** Wrong: only an end-date
  change mutated `macro_weeks`; a start-date edit updated the header only, so
  the table's derived week dates didn't move. Changed: a start-date edit now
  slides the whole cycle (new `shiftMacroWeeks` in `useMacroCycles`, week
  structure/types/notes/targets preserved), the end slides with it unless
  explicitly changed, and the top timeline strip re-fetches via a reload key.
* **Week notes expand.** Added a draggable top handle to the notes cell
  (`MacroTableV2`) — drag up to reveal, down to shorten — with a scrollable
  pre-wrap body and a textarea editor.
* **Competitions & training camps in the overview.** `TimelineMarker` gained a
  `camp` kind; the timeline strip renders camps as a labelled band, and each
  week cell shows Trophy (competition, primary=red) / Tent (camp) icons fed by a
  per-week marker bucket. Event colours extracted to `lib/eventTypes.ts`.
* **Phase week coverage.** The phase panel's coverage strip now hatches free
  weeks (vs solid claimed), shows a legend + week numbers, lists the free weeks
  ("N free weeks: W7–W9, W14"), and annotates the Start/End week dropdowns with
  each week's phase name or "(free)".
